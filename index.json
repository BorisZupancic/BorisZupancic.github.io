The player can generate balls of varying radius inside the sandbox, play with some dials controlling gravity, particle collision, time etc, and watch what happens.\nI started it to try and teach myself the C programming language, using the game engine raylib. It remains incomplete (there are some bugs, and there is more physics to add).\nIf you want to try PhysicsBox yourself, or view the source code, you can visit my GitHub.\n","date":"15 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/physics_box/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"PhysicsBox","type":"projects"},{"content":" Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here.

My supervisor is Brent Pym.\nPrior to my PhD, I completed an MSc (Project) in mathematics at Queen\u0026rsquo;s University in Kingston, ON, under the supervision of Thomas Barthelmé. My dissertation was Marked Length Spectrum Rigidity of Surfaces.\nPrior to my MSc, I completed a BSc in mathematical physics, also at Queen\u0026rsquo;s University. My BSc thesis Fuzzy Dark Matter Dynamics and the Quasi-Particle Hypothesis was supervised by Lawrence Widrow. This was a project in computational astrophysics. It resulted in my first (and as yet only) publication.\nTheses and Projects # Master\u0026rsquo;s Project: Zupancic, B.
